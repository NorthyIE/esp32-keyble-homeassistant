# esp32-keyble-homeassistant
Use an esp32 as gateway for the Eqiva Bluetooth smart lock to integrate it in Home Assistant as MQTT lock

Based on the great work of:

- **tc-maxx/esp32-keyble**

- **lumokitho/esp32-keyble**

- **MariusSchiffer/esp32-keyble**

- **oyooyo/keyble**

key points:

- Use of **NimBLE-Arduino library** (lower memory usage, less crashes)
- Home Assistant MQTT lock entity autoconfiguration!
- Some tweaks here and there
